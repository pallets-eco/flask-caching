Version 0.6.0 2012-08-12
````````````````````````

- Memoization is now safer for multiple applications using the same backing store.
- Removed the explicit set of NullCache if the Flask app is set testing=True
- Swapped Conditional order for key_prefix

Version 0.5.0 2012-02-03
````````````````````````

- Deleting memoized functions now properly functions in production
  environments where multiple instances of the application are running.
- get_memoized_names and get_memoized_keys have been removed.
- Added ``make_name`` to memoize, make_name is an optional callable that can be passed
  to memoize to modify the cache_key that gets generated.
- Added ``unless`` to memoize, this is the same as the unless parameter in ``cached``
- memoization now converts all kwargs to positional arguments, this is so that
  when a function is called multiple ways, it would evaluate to the same cache_key

Version 0.4.0 2011-12-11
````````````````````````

- Added attributes for uncached, make_cache_key, cache_timeout
  to the decorated functions.

Version 0.3.4 2011-09-10
````````````````````````

- UTF-8 encoding of cache key
- key_prefix argument of the cached decorator now supports callables.

Version 0.3.3 2011-06-03
````````````````````````

Uses base64 for memoize caching. This fixes rare issues where the cache_key
was either a tuple or larger than the caching backend would be able to
support.

Adds support for deleting memoized caches optionally based on function parameters.

Python 2.5 compatibility, plus bugfix with string.format.

Added the ability to retrieve memoized function names or cache keys.

Version 0.3.2
`````````````

Bugfix release. Fixes a bug that would cause an exception if no
``CACHE_TYPE`` was supplied.

Version 0.3.1
`````````````

Pypi egg fix.

Version 0.3
```````````

- CACHE_TYPE changed. Now one of ['null', 'simple', 'memcached',
  'gaememcached', 'filesystem'], or an import string to a function that will
  instantiate a cache object. This allows Flask-Cache to be much more
  extensible and configurable.

Version 0.2
```````````
- CACHE_TYPE now uses an import_string.
- Added CACHE_OPTIONS and CACHE_ARGS configuration values.
- Added delete_memoized

Version 0.1
```````````

- Initial public release
