Changelog
---------

Version 1.3.0 2017-06-17
````````````````````````

- Add uWSGI Caching backend (requires Werkzeug >= 0.12)
- Provide a keyword `query_string` to the cached decorator in order to create
  the same cache key for different query string requests,
  so long as they have the same key/value (order does not matter).
  PR `#35 <https://github.com/sh4nks/flask-caching/issues/35>`_.
- Use pytest as test suite and test runner. Additionally, the tests have
  been split up into multiple files instead of having one big file.

Version 1.2.0 2017-02-02
````````````````````````

- Allows functions with kwargs to be memoized correctly. See `#18 <https://github.com/sh4nks/flask-caching/issues/18>`_.

Version 1.1.1 2016-12-09
````````````````````````

- Fix PyPI Package distribution. See `#15 <https://github.com/sh4nks/flask-caching/issues/15>`_.

Version 1.1.0 2016-12-09
````````````````````````

- Fix 'redis' backend import mechanisim. See `#14 <https://github.com/sh4nks/flask-caching/pull/14>`_.
- Made backends a module to better control which cache backends to expose
  and moved our custom clients into a own module inside of the backends
  module. See also `#14 <https://github.com/sh4nks/flask-caching/pull/14>`_ (and partly some own changes).
- Some docs and test changes. See `#8 <https://github.com/sh4nks/flask-caching/pull/8>`_
  and `#12 <https://github.com/sh4nks/flask-caching/pull/12>`_.

Version 1.0.1 2016-08-30
````````````````````````

- The caching wrappers like `add`, `set`, etc are now returning the wrapped
  result as someone would expect. See `#5 <https://github.com/sh4nks/flask-caching/pull/5>`_.

Version 1.0.0 2016-07-05
````````````````````````

- Changed the way of importing Flask-Cache. Instead of using the depreacted
  method for importing Flask Extensions (via ``flask.ext.cache``),
  the name of the extension,  ``flask_cache`` is used. Have a look at
  `Flask's documentation <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.11/extensions/#flask-before-0-8>`_
  for more information regarding this matter. This also fixes the
  deprecation warning from Flask.
- Lots of PEP8 and Documentation fixes.
- Renamed this fork Flask-Caching (``flask_caching``) as it will now be
  available on PyPI for download.

merged into this fork of `Flask-Cache <https://github.com/thadeusb/flask-cache>`_:

Version 0.13 2014-04-21
```````````````````````

- Port to Python >= 3.3 (requiring Python 2.6/2.7 for 2.x).
- Fixed bug with using per-memoize timeouts greater than the default timeout
- Added better support for per-instance memoization.
- Various bug fixes

Version 0.12 2013-04-29
```````````````````````

- Changes jinja2 cache templates to use stable predictable keys. Previously
  the key for a cache tag included the line number of the template, which made
  it difficult to predict what the key would be outside of the application.
- Adds config variable `CACHE_NO_NULL_WARNING` to silence warning messages
  when using 'null' cache as part of testing.
- Adds passthrough to clear entire cache backend.

Version 0.11.1 2013-04-7
````````````````````````

- Bugfix for using memoize on instance methods.
  The previous key was id(self), the new key is repr(self)

Version 0.11 2013-03-23
```````````````````````

- Fail gracefully in production if cache backend raises an exception.
- Support for redis DB number
- Jinja2 templatetag cache now concats all args together into a single key
  instead of treating each arg as a separate key name.
- Added delete memcache version hash function
- Support for multiple cache objects on a single app again.
- Added SpreadSASLMemcached, if a value is greater than the memcached threshold
  which defaults to 1MB, this splits the value across multiple keys.
- Added support to use URL to connect to redis.

Version 0.10.1 2013-01-13
`````````````````````````

- Added warning message when using cache type of 'null'
- Changed imports to relative instead of absolute for AppEngine compatibility

Version 0.10.0 2013-01-05
`````````````````````````

- Added `saslmemcached` backend to support Memcached behind SASL authentication.
- Fixes a bug with memoize when the number of args != number of kwargs

Version 0.9.2 2012-11-18
````````````````````````

- Bugfix with default kwargs

Version 0.9.1 2012-11-16
````````````````````````

- Fixes broken memoized on functions that use default kwargs

Version 0.9.0 2012-10-14
````````````````````````

- Fixes memoization to work on methods.

Version 0.8.0 2012-09-30
````````````````````````

- Migrated to the new flask extension naming convention of flask_cache instead of flaskext.cache
- Removed unnecessary dependencies in setup.py file.
- Documentation updates

Version 0.7.0 2012-08-25
````````````````````````

- Allows multiple cache objects to be instantiated with different configuration values.

Version 0.6.0 2012-08-12
````````````````````````

- Memoization is now safer for multiple applications using the same backing store.
- Removed the explicit set of NullCache if the Flask app is set testing=True
- Swapped Conditional order for key_prefix

Version 0.5.0 2012-02-03
````````````````````````

- Deleting memoized functions now properly functions in production
  environments where multiple instances of the application are running.
- get_memoized_names and get_memoized_keys have been removed.
- Added ``make_name`` to memoize, make_name is an optional callable that can be passed
  to memoize to modify the cache_key that gets generated.
- Added ``unless`` to memoize, this is the same as the unless parameter in ``cached``
- memoization now converts all kwargs to positional arguments, this is so that
  when a function is called multiple ways, it would evaluate to the same cache_key

Version 0.4.0 2011-12-11
````````````````````````

- Added attributes for uncached, make_cache_key, cache_timeout
  to the decorated functions.

Version 0.3.4 2011-09-10
````````````````````````

- UTF-8 encoding of cache key
- key_prefix argument of the cached decorator now supports callables.

Version 0.3.3 2011-06-03
````````````````````````

Uses base64 for memoize caching. This fixes rare issues where the cache_key
was either a tuple or larger than the caching backend would be able to
support.

Adds support for deleting memoized caches optionally based on function parameters.

Python 2.5 compatibility, plus bugfix with string.format.

Added the ability to retrieve memoized function names or cache keys.

Version 0.3.2
`````````````

Bugfix release. Fixes a bug that would cause an exception if no
``CACHE_TYPE`` was supplied.

Version 0.3.1
`````````````

Pypi egg fix.

Version 0.3
```````````

- CACHE_TYPE changed. Now one of ['null', 'simple', 'memcached',
  'gaememcached', 'filesystem'], or an import string to a function that will
  instantiate a cache object. This allows Flask-Cache to be much more
  extensible and configurable.

Version 0.2
```````````
- CACHE_TYPE now uses an import_string.
- Added CACHE_OPTIONS and CACHE_ARGS configuration values.
- Added delete_memoized

Version 0.1
```````````

- Initial public release
